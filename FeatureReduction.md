🔹 The Two Main Approaches of Feature Reduction

Feature Selection – pick a subset of existing features

Remove irrelevant or redundant features

Methods: correlation check, variance threshold, feature importance

Human interpretable

Feature Extraction – create new features from existing ones

Combine original features into new ones

Example: PCA, where the machine creates principal components

Machine-friendly, not directly interpretable

🔹 Optional Third Perspective

Some people separate manual feature engineering as its own category:

Manual / Domain-based Feature Creation

You create new features yourself from domain knowledge

Example: From “height” and “weight,” create “BMI”

Human interpretable
