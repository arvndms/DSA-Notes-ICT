# 🚗 Data, Machine Learning & AI — Simple Vehicle Analogy

## 🛢️ Data = Oil
- Oil keeps the engine running smoothly
- Data keeps ML & AI working properly
- Bad oil → engine damage
- Bad data → wrong results

> **Data = Fuel for intelligence**

---

## ⚙️ Machine Learning (ML) = Engine
**Simple Meaning:**  
ML learns from data and improves over time.

### 🚙 Vehicle Example:
- Oil (data) goes into the engine
- The engine adjusts itself
- More oil & better oil → better performance

**Key Idea:**  
> **ML = Learning from data**

## 🧠 Artificial Intelligence (AI) = Driver
**Simple Meaning:**  
AI uses what ML learned to make decisions.

### 🚘 Vehicle Example:
- Driver uses the engine
- Decides when to accelerate, brake, or turn
- Controls the vehicle intelligently

**Key Idea:**  
> **AI = Making decisions**
